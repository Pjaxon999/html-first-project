        <details><summary>Why I will always love it</summary>
        <p>New Vegas is my comfort game. One of the first games I played that totally sucked me into it's delicious virtual world. The quests available to the player are incredible and are truly reactive. The writing moves from hilarity to tragedy and seriousness to sillyness with ease. Without mods it might only be an 8/10 which is no small feat but with minimal modding to increase stability and address some QOL issues the game becomes an instant 10. Some of the best DLCs in modern gaming as well that highlight the different strengths of the core game.</p>

        <details><summary>Why it makes me cry</summary>
        <p>How can a game that is so silly also be so emotionally impactful? The change from an emphasis on enclosed areas to the natural environments of the jungle allowed the series to grow towards a gameplay peak. Guards were able to have much more fair sightlines, and the player has many more options for interacting with them. Telling the story of how Big Boss becomes the bad guy fills in some holes in the backstory of the first two games whilst also kickstarting it's own story that would culminate with MGSV. Both new and returning characters are well acted and well written. Gregson-Williams' score is also fantastic and deserves a nod.</p>

        <p>For those curious, this is how I would rate the main line entries into the series:

            <li>MGS2</li>
            <li>MGS5
                <ul>
                    <li>Would be #1 if they had finished it</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>MGS1</li>
            <li>MGS4
                <ul>
                    <li>I wish the game could sustain the quality of Act 2</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>I haven't played Peace Walker enough to rank it here but based on my first playthrough I would guess it would be on the same level as MGS1 for me.</p>

        <details><summary>Why it makes me laugh AND cry</summary>
        <p>The writing in this game is painfully good. The concept of having different aspects of your personality/psyche be able to engage with the player in dialogue is worth the asking price alone. But then they went ahead and wrote in a plethora of compelling characters and stories that each play into a player driven narrative that had me shedding tears of both laughter and sadness. Visually artistically inspired as well. I want a massive print of the thought cabinet on my wall. I could get lost in this image for hours:</p>

        <details><summary>Why I love to get lost in it's world</summary>
        <p>For me, this game is a flawed masterpiece. Nothing is perfect, and the second half of the game struggles to deliver on the promise of the first half while still having some good moments, but the total package, particularly with the DLC, is truly incredible. The combination of sound design, gameplay, level design, and visuals that lends a kind of authenticity to the ruined dark fantasy world the player experiences is why FromSoftware gets a pass to keep unsubtley remaking this game over and over again.</p>

        <details><summary>Why I loved it</summary>
        <p>I never got tired of playing this game when I played casually with friends, and I never got tired of it when I played it competitvely as a member of the smash community. I mostly just got tired of myself playing the game instead. A happy accident that a fighitng game could work on both the level of being fun at parties whilst also being able to be played at such a dazzlingly high level competitvely. There will also be a special magic in experiencing Ganondorf hit Pikachu so hard that he is transported to a different part of the galaxy.</p>
